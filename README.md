This file would, of course, not be included in a real release.

This repository, and especially the commit history contained within it, should help put your mind at ease that none of this code was AI-written or assisted.

The e-mail and username associated with this repository are different from my legal name. This repository and all the code contained therein is still the sole work of Robert Nathaniel Grzelak. Kass is my preferred name.
